							<h2>Our Idea</h2>
							India is the land of over billion people. Despite the booming technology industry and decades of robust economic growth, greater than 90% of this billion still have no access to computers. Computers connected to internet are a gateway to information that could help farmers improve yields, guide small and medium scale industries find nationwide markets or help students qualify for higher education. However, the cost of having a computer makes it beyond the reach of most households. Today, greater than 55% of households in India have a television (TV) set. TV has been a great medium for mass media communication and has come a long way since its introduction. Another characteristic of this decade is that mobile network has reached the farthest corners of India. This is indicated by the fact that 62% of population is connected via mobile network. Hence in theory Internet is accessible to them via GPRS. This creates a window of opportunity for designing products which would connect display sets like TV with readily available mobile internet to create a full fledged low cost personal computer.</div><!-- /.col -->
						<div class=" col-sm-6 inner-right-xs inner-bottom-xs">
							<br><br>
							With PeaPod we aim at providing viable low cost portable computing and internet facility without compromising on usability. This product would be capable of interfacing with ordinarily available visual devices including television sets. On the other hand it would feature an easily attachable modem capable of connecting to internet over mobile networks. It would have the form factor of a tiffin box and thus is portable. It would have a host of connectors to ensure interchangeability of I/O devices and upgradation using plug-n-play hardware. It would not include a display device, however a second hand dealership is envisioned. Huge number of CRT television sets and monitors are being discarded in metros. An option to buy through this channel would be provided to those who don’t have one.

							<h2>Product Capabilities</h2>
							PeaPod can be described as combination of Pea & Pod.
							<h3>Pod – The Hardware:</h3>
							‘Pod’ is basically a normal computer’s CPU but with the form factor of a tiffin box.

								<strong>PeaPod Specifications</strong>
</p>
<p>Different use case scenarios would have different ways of accessing the internet. Hence we have the PeaPod system separated into two main components:</p>
<li dir="ltr">
The PeaPod Root, which is the main computer
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
The PeaPod Bloom, which is the customisable part for providing connectivity using one of either WiFi, ethernet or mobile network.
</li>
<p>The PeaPod Root is a stand alone component which contains the main computer. It is powerful enough for day-to-day tasks like internet browsing, education applications and multimedia playback. Hardware Specifications:</p>
<li dir="ltr">
Complete system on a chip.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
1.2GHz <span class="caps">ARM</span> Cortex A8 processor (Planned upgradation to dual core A9)
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
1GB <span class="caps">RAM</span>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<span class="caps">RCA</span> Video &amp; Audio: Connecting to existing display devices like televisions.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<span class="caps">VGA</span>/<span class="caps">HDMI</span> Connector: For monitors and better TV sets.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
3.5mm Audio Jack: Sound output
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
SD Card Slot : On board SD card storage
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
4x <span class="caps">USB</span> : For connecting additional devices.
</li>

			<ul>
				<li>The PeaPod Bloom is a network adaptor for the Root. They would provide access to an internet connection. The following Blooms would be available:****</li>
			</ul><li dir="ltr">
Ethernet &amp; WiFi (Phase I)
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<span class="caps">GPRS</span> (Phase II)
</li>
<p>A complete PeaPod package would consist of both the PeaPod Root, a selection from one of the PeaPod Blooms and all the relevant software applications. Costs would be minimized since the customer only takes the network hardware that is required.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
Pea &#8211; The software
</h3>
<p>To make this product useful to wide audiences without assuming any previous proficiency in handling it, we plan to ship it bundled with a battery of targeted software</p>
<li dir="ltr">
Android 4.0 and Linux Desktop – user choice.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
Tutorials : To get people familiar to PeaPod environment without much human assistance we plan to have spoken tutorials for all the everyday features of computer.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
Apps : <span class="caps">IRCTC</span> booking, check weather, market prices, basic educational apps.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
Browser : Tailor made for the above hardware constraints
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
Info Portals : Information Portals selected based on target audience. Examples could be step by step introduction to apiculture, sericulture etc.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
Language Accessibility : Support for most of the Indian Languages and “Read on Click” feature to read aloud in the particular language (for illiterate people), would serve as a simple and direct literacy tool.
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
PeaPod CS : PeaPod Cloud Services is our content delivery system for the PeaPod device. All applications developed specifically would be distributed via this. PeaPod CS would also be host to our low bandwidth cloud based services.
</li>
<p><b id="internal-source-marker_0.35964551428332925"> The System-on-Chip technology that makes the PeaPod possible at such a low cost is very cutting-edge and rapidly developing. We would be keeping an eye on newer developments in the market so as to adapt the PeaPod and make it more powerful and user friendly while keeping down costs.</b></p>

	<ol>
		<li>Where can PeaPod be used ?</li>
	</ol><p>PeaPod can be used as a stand-in replacement for a box cpu. It gives the same power as normal cpu at a lower cost and portability. Some applications are  :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Smart TV Applications</li>
	<li>Billing Desk</li>
	<li>Desktop Computer</li>
	<li>Industrial Control</li>
</ul></figure></section>
