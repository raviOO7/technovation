							<h2>Abstract</h2>
							 In recent years the subject of wing vehicles propelled by flapping wings, also known as ornithopters, has been an area of interest because of its application to micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). These miniature vehicles seek to mimic small birds and insects to achieve never before seen agility in flight. This renewed interest has raised a host of new problems in vehicle dynamics and control to explore.

           The main objective of the project is to develop flapping wing model which will be capable of carrying certain payload in flight. The conceptual design of this ornithopter can be used for various future applications including military and surveillance objectives.  The purpose of this report is to shed light on newly developed conceptual design and control algorithms that can be implemented to control the vehicle.
